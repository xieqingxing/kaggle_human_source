*This dataset is simulated

Why are our best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely? Have fun with this database and try to predict which valuable employees will leave next. Fields in the dataset include:

1. Satisfaction Level
2. Last evaluation
3. Number of projects
4. Average monthly hours
5. Time spent at the company
6. Whether they have had a work accident
7. Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years
8. Departments
9. Salary
10. Whether the employee has left

Hope it helps,
